# 👋 Hi there, I'm Christopher Atuonah (a.k.a QAtuonah)!

🎯 **QA Analyst | Manual Testing Specialist | Deepening Skills in Automation, AI Testing, and Data Validation**

With 6+ years of experience in software quality assurance, I've worked across the finance, automotive, and gaming industries — ensuring high-quality, reliable digital products. My core expertise lies in **manual testing**, where I’ve led test planning and execution. I'm currently transitioning into **test automation** and **AI/ML validation**, sharpening my skills in **Python, Selenium, and SQL**.

🧠 I love learning, breaking things (intentionally 😄), and helping teams ship bug-free software.
